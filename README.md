# About Me
I am Mohamed Mekawy (0xMekawy), a dedicated cybersecurity professional with a deep passion for ethical hacking, penetration testing, and proactive security strategies. Currently pursuing a degree in Computers and Data Science major cybersecurity, I have developed a strong technical foundation that enables me to approach cybersecurity challenges with precision, analytical thinking, and a hackerâ€™s mindset one that seeks to break security barriers to build stronger defenses.
From the outset of my journey, I immersed myself in programming, networking, and system security, which provided me with a well-rounded understanding of cybersecurity. I began with core programming languages such as Java (OOP), Python, and PHP, which laid the groundwork for understanding system logic and software security. I pursued network security certifications, including CCNA, gaining proficiency in networking protocols, infrastructure security. 
I have completed specialized training in penetration testing methodologies through eJPT, Security+, and EC-Council courses, focusing on identifying, exploiting, and mitigating security vulnerabilities. I have hands-on experience in web application security, network penetration testing, and vulnerability assessment, particularly working with OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques. Understanding the importance of infrastructure security, I have developed strong expertise in network security architecture, intrusion detection, and firewall management. My CCNA certification has enabled me to analyze and secure network environments efficiently. Additionally, I have extensive experience working with Windows and Linux operating systems, particularly Kali Linux and BlackArch, which are essential for penetration testing. 
My interest in low-level security and exploit development has led me to study stack buffer overflow techniques, advanced exploitation tactics and mitigate potential attack vectors. I have an intermediate understanding of cryptography, cryptanalysis, and applied cryptographic techniques, having completed specialized EC-Council courses. With a comprehensive knowledge of SDLC and SSDLC. 
I have gained insights into Blue Team operations, proactive security strategies, and incident response, enabling me to contribute effectively to both attack and defense aspects of cybersecurity. I am committed to identifying weaknesses before malicious actors do leveraging penetration testing, ethical hacking, and proactive security strategies to strengthen digital infrastructures.
